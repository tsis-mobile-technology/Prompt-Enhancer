## Research and Inspiration

Prompt Enhancer incorporates various prompt engineering techniques grounded in the principles from VILA-Lab's [Principled Instructions Are All You Need for Questioning LLaMA-1/2, GPT-3.5/4 (2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16171.pdf). 
Additionally, the tool offers users the option to incorporate emotional prompts such as "This is very important to my career," inspired by Microsoft's [Large Language Models Understand and Can Be Enhanced by Emotional Stimuli (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11760.pdf). Users can also choose to include phrases like "Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step," which encourage AI to deliver better responses, which is validated by Google DeepMind's [Large Language Models as Optimizers (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03409.pdf).


## Technical Stack

1. **Streamlit**: Creates an intuitive user interface for an engaging user experience.
2. **LangChain**: Seamlessly integrates large language models into the application.
3. **OpenAI API**: Connects to the OpenAI models to provide real-time prompt enhancement.
